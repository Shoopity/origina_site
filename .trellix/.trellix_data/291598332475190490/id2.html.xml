Dabney, and his wife Ruth, established this guest ranch and fishing and hunting camp in 1924.&nbsp; It has been kept much the same as it was then. New outhouses were constructed in the summer of 2007 and&nbsp;new mattresses were installed on all the beds in 2008. A shower house with hot water is available. Staying at the Ranch offers a unique opportunity to experience pioneer life in the west, much as it was 100 years ago.</strong></font></p><p><font size="4"></font></p><p><font size="4">This is a photo of John G.

<P><FONT face=arial,helvetica,sans-serif size=4><STRONG>Thanks </STRONG></FONT><FONT face=arial,helvetica,sans-serif size=4><STRONG>for your interest in the Continental Ranch, located approximately 30 miles SW of Creede, CO on US Forest Road 513.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=arial,helvetica,sans-serif size=4><STRONG>The Ranch is located in a high mountain park known as North Clear Creek Park, named for the stream that flows through the park and the Ranch property. The elevation is about 10,000 feet above sea level, making it an ideal place for folks to escape the hot summer weather of lower elevations.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=arial,helvetica,sans-serif size=4><STRONG>Surrounding the park and the Ranch are forested mountains with plenty of opportunity for horse back riding, hiking, fishing and&nbsp;hunting in season and almost any other outdoor mountain activity you can think of.&nbsp; The view of the surrounding mountains is magnificent, something one never tires of looking at.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<H1><FONT face=arial,helvetica,sans-serif size=4>Horses and pets are wecome at the Continental Ranch. We ask that you keep your pets from disturbing other guests, and that you let us know ahead of time if you will be bringing your horse.&nbsp; There&nbsp;are 100 acres of horse pasture available. There are many thousands of acres of Rio Grande National Forest available adjacent to the Ranch for hiking and riding. </FONT></H1>
<H1><FONT face=arial,helvetica,sans-serif size=4>Freemon's Ranch, our nearest neighbor (about 12 miles away) has horses available to rent. Freemon's also has a general store and grill with great hamburgers. Colorado fishing licenses are available at Freemon's. </FONT></H1>
<H1><FONT face=arial,helvetica,sans-serif size=4>Lake fishing is available within a few miles of the Ranch on the Continental Reservoir, Rito Hondo Lake, and several other great fishing spots in the area. Stream fishing is available on North Clear Creek which runs through the Ranch, and a number of other streams close by.</FONT></H1>
<H1><FONT face=arial,helvetica,sans-serif size=4><STRONG>ATVs are also welcome. We ask that you obey the regulations regarding on- road and off-road use of these vehicles.</STRONG></FONT></H1>
